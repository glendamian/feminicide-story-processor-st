Thanks to the more than two-thirds of adults who&#8217;ve been vaccinated already, we can finally do the things that we&#8217;ve missed doing for the last year.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<p>In New Hampshire, the state&#8217;s coronavirus state-of-emergency will expire Friday night and Gov. Chris Sununu has said he would not be renewing it. A public health incident status will remain in place, Sununu said, allowing healthcare providers and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate further Covid-19 efforts.</p>\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about vaccination,&#8221; Sununu said at a briefing on Thursday. &#8220;We have a very high rate of vaccination with both our healthcare staff and the residents themselves, which is great and we&#8217;re going to keep encouraging that.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://kvia.com/health/2021/06/11/vaccinations-remain-our-best-fight-against-covid-19-which-could-surge-again-in-the-winter-expert-warns/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vaccinations remain our best fight against Covid-19, which could surge again in the winter, expert warns</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://kvia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">KVIA</a>.</p>",

But officials continue to warn that those unvaccinated remain vulnerable to the virus, especially to dangerous variants which could set back national progress against the pandemic if they become more widespread. Nationwide, 64% of adults have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and about 53% are fully vaccinated, yet the Biden administration\u2019s goal of 70% of adults with at least one dose of vaccine by July 4 will fall short at the current pace. More than a dozen states have hit that goal as of this week, according to the CDC. Barriers to access along economic lines , vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have been cited as contributing factors to a slowing of vaccination rates in the US from earlier highs. \u201cThis kind of doubting the safety of vaccines, doubting the necessity of vaccines \u2026 it is very, very dangerous, and a lot of people are hearing this,\u201d CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner said Thursday. In five states \u2014 Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Wyoming \u2014 fewer than half of adult residents have received one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to CDC data published Thursday. As officials try to quicken the rate of vaccination, recent data gives further credence that vaccines are some of the best tools to fight against variants that could otherwise exacerbate the pandemic. Two doses of Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s coronavirus vaccine appear to provide good protection against some of the worrisome new variants circulating, including the B.1.617.2 or Delta variant first seen in India, researchers reported Thursday. \u201cNew variants will continue to emerge as the pandemic persists,\u201d researchers said, noting there has been no evidence that variants have largely escaped such vaccine protections. \u201cTherefore, increasing the proportion of the population immunized with current safe and effective authorized vaccines remains a key strategy to minimize the emergence of new variants and end the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d. . FDA discussion over vaccinating children continues. As the efficacy of vaccines is demonstrated in adults, the US Food and Drug Administration discussed Thursday whether additional measures are needed in the potential vaccination of children ages 11 and younger. Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s vaccine is authorized for use in people ages 12 and up. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is authorized in people 18 and older, although the company has asked the FDA to authorize its use in children as young as 12. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine is authorized in people ages 18 and older. One member of a panel of FDA vaccine advisers spoke out strongly against extending emergency use authorization to coronavirus vaccines for children under the age of 12, saying more safety data is needed. \u201cBefore we start vaccinating millions of adolescents and children, it\u2019s important to find out what the consequences are,\u201d said Dr. Cody Meissner, director of pediatric infectious diseases at Tufts University School of Medicine, who advocated for more extensive testing. Meissner spoke with CNN on Thursday and said he was particularly worried by recent reports about a possible link between the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and myocarditis, or heart inflammation, among younger people. \u201cWe need a vaccine for adolescents and children,\u201d Meissner told CNN. \u201cBut I think we also want to be sure that the benefit exceeds the risk.\u201d. Meissner also praised the success of vaccinations so far against the pandemic, saying, \u201cThese vaccines are equivalent to our accomplishments in space.\u201d. FDA adviser Dr. Paul Offit told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he was \u201cconfident that there was unanimity\u201d among advisers on the importance of having a Covid-19 vaccine for children despite disagreement over how potential vaccines are researched and authorized. \u201cI certainly think we would have a vaccine by early next year, and hopefully we\u2019ll have a vaccine for the 6-to-12-year-old by the end of the year,\u201d Offit said. \u201cIf we\u2019re past the pandemic \u2014 if this is all behind us \u2014 then that\u2019s not going to be an issue, but we\u2019re not past the pandemic,\u201d Offit added. \u201cThe variants are still out there and becoming more contagious. I think when the winter comes, you\u2019re going to see this virus surge again, so we still need a vaccine.\u201d. . More Covid-19 restrictions loosen. Masks no longer have to be worn in outdoor areas of public transportation by individuals fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to new guidance released by the CDC Thursday. For those who are not vaccinated, the CDC advises continued mask adherence. \u201cWhile those who are fully vaccinated may resume many activities without wearing a mask, the travel environment presents a unique set of circumstances based on the number and close interaction of travelers (both vaccinated and unvaccinated),\u201d the CDC stated. Additional cities and states this week lessened Covid-19 restrictions in light of improving news. Philadelphia on Friday ended its indoor mask mandate as well as 11 p.m. last calls for restaurants, according to a release from the city. \u201cFor nearly fifteen months, the City of Philadelphia has had restrictions in place to protect each other, and I have no doubt that these restrictions saved countless lives,\u201d Mayor Jim Kenney said. \u201cBut Friday will be a day that we\u2019ve all been looking forward to: getting back to doing the things that we love. Thanks to the more than two-thirds of adults who\u2019ve been vaccinated already, we can finally do the things that we\u2019ve missed doing for the last year.\u201d. In New Hampshire, the state\u2019s coronavirus state-of-emergency will expire Friday night and Gov. Chris Sununu has said he would not be renewing it. A public health incident status will remain in place, Sununu said, allowing healthcare providers and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate further Covid-19 efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s about vaccination,\u201d Sununu said at a briefing on Thursday. \u201cWe have a very high rate of vaccination with both our healthcare staff and the residents themselves, which is great and we\u2019re going to keep encouraging that.\u201d. . .",
